# POC Vite Build -- Devlog

I'm trying to access an asset that has been added after the build.

The goal is to do something like a mixin, where the static website has been pre-generated but the data comes during run time.

In that case, the output of a CLI app.

I'm gonna try this : https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#new-url-url-import-meta-url
